# L2 Q5: play rock-paper-scissor - Beat the King
# You need to win the king three times in a row in order to throw him away from his throne
# Carefully think about where a loop should be place
# Suggested Logic:
#
# Repeat the following until you really win
#        Challenge the king three times, in each challenge
#               pick a choice for the King and a choice for the player
#               Repeat this if it is draw
#                      pick a choice for the King and a choice for the player
#               if fail the challenge, break from this loop
#
