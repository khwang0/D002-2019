# L1 Worksheet

Greetings! There are two parts you need to get familiar with in this lesson. The first part is to create a Github account and *fork* this repository.
Forking a project means you are copying the repository to your account. When you change things on the repository of your account, the file on this repository 
would not be affected. In each of the lessons you are asked to finish some python files. Drag those finished python files to your forked repository
to upload them. I will grade your work on github. So make sure you have uploaded those files before you leave the classroom.

The second part is about some python basics that you have learnt in class.

## Instruction for Github:

**To be shown in class**

## Lab task

1. Write your very first `Hello World` program. Name the file as `YourEnglishName.py` *Note: otherwise I wouldn't know who own this Github repo*.

2. Write the code that calculate arithemtic shown on page 35 and 41. Name the file as `Q2.py`

3. Write the code for the circle calculator shown on page 50. The program shall allow user to enter the radius of a circle and 
output the area of a circle with 2 decimal place. Name the file `Q3.py` (*Noted: You may want to use `pi` from the `math` library. In this case, type `from math import pi` at the beginning of the py file.*)
> Please input the radius of the circle
>
> 20
>
> The circle area is 1256.64

4. Write the code for determining a year is leap year or not. The program shall allow user to enter the year and output either "Yes, it is a leap year" or "No, it is not a leap year". Name the file `Q4.py`.

5. Starts with the skeleton code [Q5.py](Q5.py) and complete the Paper-Rock-Scissor game. The game will ask the user to input 1,2 or 3. The game randomly pick paper or rock or scissor and prints it choice.
Finally the game will say the either "player wins", "player lose", or "draw". Name the file `Q5.py`.
